Place to back up and develop my screeps code

Screeps is a really cool game for programmers that runs 24/7. if you're here and you don't know what it is, be sure to check it out.

I'm designing my code to be drag-and-drop compatible. Essentially my goal is that anyone could take my code, make a spawn in the game, and all they would have to do is add construction sites. While unrealistic, I think it's a good challenge.

ToDo List.js is a short list of goals I want to work on.
