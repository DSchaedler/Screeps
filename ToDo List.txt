/**
 * optimize code to avoid CPU spkies.
 * design system to claim and auto-manage new room
 * make code to automaticly build roads.
 * commend myself for some of the smart code I've already written
 * find a better structure for harvester spawning code
 * movers prioritize dropped energy
 * better pathing using room.serializePath();
 * might have all but a couple movers ignore upgraders, but have those few give them top priority
